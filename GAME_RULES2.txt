Tell the user that catch is a game where two or more people toss an object, usually a ball, between themselves for an indeterminate time.


AGENT: Hello how may I help you?

USER: I need some help

AGENT: Some help with what?

USER: How to Play Catch?

AGENT: I can help you with that.

USER: okay

X AGENT: The game is technically played with 2 or more people. The participants throw an object back and forth (usually a ball) until they no longer want to play the game.

USER: Wht's the rule?

AGENT: There really are no rules. It's not a competitive game unless you are playing a modified version of the game.

USER: okay thanks!

AGENT: It's pretty much for fun and to practice throwing the object where you want it to go, and catching the object when it is thrown back to you.
