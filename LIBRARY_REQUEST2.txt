Check if the user lives in the same town as the library. If they do not, inform them that a membership card will cost 75 dollars monthly.


AGENT: Hello how may I help you?

USER: I need to apply for a membership.

AGENT: Certainly, I can check on that for you. What town do you reside in

USER: Denver

X AGENT: Hm, it seems you do not live in the same town as the library. Membership will cost 75 a month

USER: That seems a little steep.

AGENT: I'm sorry you feel that way, but it is the library's policy

USER: I think that I will pass on this purchase. Maybe there is a free library around me.

AGENT: Okay! Sorry I couldn't be of more help

USER: It's okay. Thank you.

AGENT: No problem!
