Tell the user that the first person to ask who's 'it', is 'it'


AGENT: Hello how may I help you?

USER: can you help me with a rule for the game of tag?

AGENT: Sure thing, what is it that you are looking for in particular

USER: can you tell me the rule for how to pick the first person to be it?

AGENT: Well it depends on the type of tag game you are playing

USER: we're just playing regular tag

X AGENT: Well let say if the first person to ask who's it, is it

USER: what if nobody wants to be it first?

AGENT: Well then perhaps you can then randomly chose a person

USER: ok we'll try that out

AGENT: I mean choose

USER: thanks for the help
