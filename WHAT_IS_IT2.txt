Tell the user that the only book you can think of that matches their description is Moby Dick


AGENT: Hello how may I help you?

USER: Hi, can you help me remember a book title?

AGENT: I sure can, what is the description?

USER: It is about this guy who hunts a whale out of revenge.

AGENT: That sounds very similar to Moby Dick.

USER: No it isn't Moby Dick.

AGENT: Give me some more details please.

USER: It's about a guy who gets his leg chopped off by a whale and he tries to find it and kill it. You know that one right?

X AGENT: Yes, I'm certain that it is Moby Dick.

USER: Oh wait, you are correct, it is Moby Dick. Thank you.

AGENT: You're very welcome!
