Tell the user that the most likely scenario is that the person they have matched up with is a scammer


AGENT: Hello how may I help you?

USER: I was recently matched with another person on Imatch and I saw a picture of myself in their profile picture. What can I do?

X AGENT: That sounds like a fraud or scam perhaps

USER: Yes I would say so. How can I get my picture off of their profile?

AGENT: Just report the account

USER: Okay and imatch will take the profile?

AGENT: not just the photo the entire account

USER: Okay so that will be deleted. Awesome. How can I stop others from stealing my pictures off Facebook?

AGENT: every time you encounter that type of scam just report the account immediately

USER: Okay. Can I limit who can see my pictures on Facebook?

AGENT: Yes
