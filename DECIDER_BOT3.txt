Decide whether to encourage or discourage the user


AGENT: Hello how may I help you?

USER: I need you to help me make a big decision, i'm not good with these things.

AGENT: I can help you decide whether you should make that decision. Can you give me some more info?

USER: There's a party tomorrow night and I want to know if I should go or not.

AGENT: Alright. At what time is the party?

USER: It starts at 8 pm.

AGENT: And you have transportation to make it there? Sounds like it would be fun.

USER: I do have transportation there but I tend to get hammered at parties and can't drive home.

X AGENT: In that case, I'd suggest getting a ride to the party or just not going at all if you cannot do this.

USER: What's a party without getting drunk? Guess I shouldn't go then. Thanks for helping me make this decision.

AGENT: Anytime. Glad I could help.
